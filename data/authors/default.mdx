Hi, I'm Robbie!

I started this blog to document my journey into software development. I have experience going back to about 2012 in various open source projects with different languages and frameworks, even some brief production experience.

The goal is to jump back in and build a few working applications with technologies I am unfamiliar with, other than a short course or tutorial in the past. Then start looking for a job.
