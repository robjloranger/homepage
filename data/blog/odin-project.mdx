This will serve as a basic record of the projects I complete as I study the Full Stack Javascript pathway from The Odin Project.

## Basic Recipe Site

Quick into to HTML and CSS, using a few simple pages.

## Landing page

This landing page project starts with just a couple images for reference, a mock up and some style information. Still just HTML and CSS but starting to use things like flexbox.
