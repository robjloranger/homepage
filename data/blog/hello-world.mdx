Hey! I'm Robbie.

I am a software enthusiast on a journey to become a developer.

The goal of this blog is document my success and struggles as I build a portfolio of projects.

## What's the plan?

I had an idea. I have contributed to open source over the years and built plenty of personal projects, however I deleted my GitHub account a few years back.. so no proof. I have run numerous applications and services in the wild, including a DNS pair, chat servers forums, and many more just using Docker containers. I have also participated in the development of a production web app, which is now defunct and out of business.. And for a short time I also got paid to work on a hybrid open-source/paid service.

The experiment will be to build a number of applications using technologies I am only vaguely familiar with. Proving that I am not only able learn new things, but also to build a portfolio.

## What's first?

I will start by building a storefront, using NodeJS and React. Might as well also use TypeScript while I'm at it.

The MVP will include: items, basic inventory, administration, authentication, checkout and payment processing.
