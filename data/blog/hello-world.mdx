Hey! I'm Robbie.

I am a software enthusiast on a journey to become a developer.

The purpose of this blog will be to document my success and struggles as I build a portfolio of projects.

## What's the plan?

I have an idea. I have always contributed to open source over the years, however I deleted my GitHub account a few years back.. so no proof. I have also participated in the development of a production web app, which is now defunct and out of business.. So it is time to build some lasting demonstration of my abilities.

The experiment will be to build a number of products using technologies I am only vaguely familiar with. Proving that I am able learn new things at the same time as building a portfolio.

## What's first?

I will build a store front, using NodeJS and React. Might as well also use TypeScript while I'm at it.

The MVP will include: items, basic inventory, administration, authentication, checkout and payment processing.
