First day of week zero. I am still finishing the Foundations Course from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.org) but am moving on to the last section: JavaScript.

The previous section projects were a good, quick, reintroduction to HTML and CSS. The landing page probably took a couple hours.

You can see all my Odin related projects [here](/blog/odin-project). I will update that page as I go along, you can follow along with the [RSS](/feed.xml) feed if you like.
